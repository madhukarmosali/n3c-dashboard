		<br><b>Figure 1. Cumulative % of patients who have a care visit after a 5 day
		Paxlovid course. Upper Panel: 838 patients with U07.1 visits (a code
		indicating the visit is COVID-related);</b> Lower Panel: 3,676 patients
		with any clinical visit (i.e. those with a diagnosis code). The
		figures illustrate that few patients receiving care post-Paxlovid test
		positive for COVID-19, even when their visits include a COVID-19
		diagnosis (upper panel). Note that 22 Paxlovid-treated individuals
		(not shown) tested positive but did not have a subsequent visit with a
		diagnosis of any kind.

		<br><b>Figure 2. Heatmap showing new or continuing diagnoses in the
		three-weeks post-Paxlovid.</b> Shown are major categories of diagnoses
		recorded post-Paxlovid course for patients testing COVID positive,
		negative, or those with unknown test status. Patients largely show a
		moderate increase in pulmonary and urinary/kidney symptomatology for
		those testing positive over those who are testing negative or those
		whose testing status is unknown (which may indicate a lack of need for
		clinical testing and/or evaluation).
