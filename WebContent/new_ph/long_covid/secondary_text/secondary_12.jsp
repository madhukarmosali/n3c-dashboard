	<p>Sample: Patients in the N3C Data Enclave who do not have a
	laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test, do not have a 
	laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 Antibody test, and do not have a medical visit 
	in which the ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) was recorded. This sample may have instances 
	of false negatives when using it to assess the population of COVID-19/PASC-negative persons. 
	This can be caused by a lack of testing, non-reported testing, and reported testing not captured by our 
	data partners (i.e., testing done at an unrelated institution).  </p>
